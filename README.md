ðŸš€ Project Spotlight: Email Spam Identification with Naive Bayes Classification ðŸ§ 
I'm excited to share my latest project, Bag of Words (BOW), where I've been diving deep into email spam detection using the Naive Bayes Classification algorithm. This journey has taken me through the essential steps of data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and modeling.

Starting with a dataset of emails, I worked on transforming the text data into a structured format using the Bag of Words technique. Through this method, I converted raw text into numerical features, which the Naive Bayes algorithm could then use to classify emails as either "ham" (not spam) or "spam."

Here's a glimpse of the process:
â€¢	Data Wrangling & EDA: Understanding the dataset and cleaning the data.
â€¢	Feature Engineering: Using the CountVectorizer to create a Bag of Words representation.
â€¢	Modeling: Training the Naive Bayes classifier to identify spam emails.
This project was a hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, showcasing how we can leverage these tools to tackle real-world problems like spam detection. ðŸ“§
